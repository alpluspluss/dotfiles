# Dotfiles

My personal configuration files for Arch Linux & Hyprland. It only features a minimal
amount of configuration files to make Arch Linux work. This repository also contains 
a few C++ utilities source code that I need for everyday uses in [`bin`](bin/README.md).

The current setup is based on [end-4's illogical impulse](https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland)
but modified for performance. As such, its license notice could be found [here](licenses/GPL-3.0.txt).

## Installation

There is no way to install this currently as it is a work in progress.

## License
